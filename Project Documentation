This project is a fantastic way to learn how to make an application "resilient." In simple terms, we are building a safety net: if your main server (Primary) crashes, your traffic automatically moves to a backup server (Secondary), and your data is safe because of automated backups.
Here is your beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide to implementing Project 6: Disaster Recovery Setup.

Phase 1: Set Up AWS Backup (The Safety Net)
Think of this like an "Auto-Save" feature for your entire cloud infrastructure.

1. Create a Backup Vault
Action: Go to the AWS Backup console and click Backup vaults on the left.

Why: This is a "container" where your backups are stored and encrypted.

Step: Click Create Backup vault, give it a name (e.g., MyProjectVault), and keep the default encryption settings.

2. Create a Backup Plan
Action: Click Backup Plans -> Create Backup Plan.
Step: Choose Build a new plan.
Setup: * Backup rule name: DailyBackup.
Frequency: Set to Daily.
Retention: How long do you want to keep the data? For a lab, 1 day or 7 days is fine to avoid costs.
Vault: Select the MyProjectVault you just created.

3. Assign Resources
Action: Inside your plan, find Resource assignment.
Step: Click Assign resources. Give it a name like MyResources.
Choice: You can choose "Include all resource types" (expensive) or select specific ones like an existing EC2 instance or RDS database.

Phase 2: Set Up Route 53 (The Traffic Controller)
Now we need a way to tell the internet: "If Server A is dead, go to Server B."

1. Set Up Health Checks
Action: Go to Route 53 -> Health checks.
Why: This monitors if your website is actually working.

Step: Click Create health check.
IP address: Enter the IP of your Primary Server.
Protocol: HTTP (Port 80) or HTTPS (Port 443).
Result: AWS will now ping your server every 30 seconds to see if it's "Healthy."

2. Configure DNS Failover Policy
Action: Go to Hosted zones and select your domain name. (If you don't have a domain, you can skip to testing the theory, but this usually requires a domain).

Step: Create two records with the same name (e.g., app.yourdomain.com):
Record 1 (Primary):
Routing Policy: Failover.
Failover Record Type: Primary.
Health Check: Select the one you created above.

Record 2 (Secondary):

Routing Policy: Failover.
Failover Record Type: Secondary.
Point this to your DR (Disaster Recovery) instance IP.

Phase 3: Simulate a Disaster (The Final Test)
This is the most important part! We want to see if our work actually functions.
Stop the Primary Server: Go to your EC2 console and Stop your primary instance.
Wait: Give it 2–3 minutes. The Route 53 Health Check will see the server is down and turn "Unhealthy."

Check the URL: Refresh your website URL. Route 53 should now be pointing you to the Secondary/Backup server.

Restore Data: Go to AWS Backup -> Protected resources. Select a backup and click Restore. This proves you can bring back your data if the original was deleted.

Pro-Tips for Beginners:
IAM Roles: Ensure your user has permissions for both AWS Backup and Route 53.

Region Strategy: For a "Real" DR project, put your Backup/Secondary server in a different region (e.g., Primary in US-East-1, Secondary in US-West-2). This protects you even if a whole part of the country has a power outage.

Cleanup: To avoid charges, delete the Backup Plan and Release the Elastic IPs once you are finished with the project!
